# This is a helper script for adding students' gravatar icons to their
# blogs on the Python Summer of Code blog aggregator.

# Gravatar uses an md5 hash of email to identify each user, so we
# take a spreadsheet that includes student names and emails and output
# something that can be cut/pasted into the aggregator config file.
